# Hybrid AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A **production-ready** hybrid NIDS combining:
- Signature-based detection (rule engine)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest / XGBoost)
- Deep Learning (LSTM for sequential anomalies)
- Real-time traffic monitoring
- MLOps with MLflow + DVC
- Docker deployment
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard

Built on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset with multi-class attack detection (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R, Botnet, Web Attack, etc.).

## Features
- Real-time packet capture and flow analysis
- Hybrid detection: signatures + AI
- Explainable AI with SHAP
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Full MLOps pipeline
- Docker containerization

## Tech Stack
Python • Scikit-learn • TensorFlow • Scapy • nfstream • MLflow • DVC • Streamlit • Docker
